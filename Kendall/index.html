            </div>
        </h2>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            Hello! I'm <strong>Kendall Ramos</strong>, a proud graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a 3.71 GPA. My roots are in Houston, Texas, and I've always been captivated by the world of technology.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            My journey into tech began with a love for video games, especially "Super Monkey Ball" on the GameCube. This game sparked my initial dream of becoming a game developer, fascinated by the complex physics, 3D graphics, and the immersive experience it provided. However, as I delved deeper into the world of coding and technology, I discovered a passion for software engineering that far surpassed my initial ambitions.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            What drew me to software engineering was the vast potential to solve real-world problems and create impactful solutions. I realized that while game development was about crafting virtual worlds, software engineering allowed me to build systems and applications that directly improve people's lives. The ability to take a concept, break it down into logical components, and turn it into a functioning piece of software felt like a natural extension of my creativity and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            Today, I am excited about using my skills in various programming languages like Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and Python to innovate and build solutions. Iâ€™ve worked on a diverse range of projects, from a Meal Prep App that calculates BMI and suggests meal plans to a Bedbug Incident Database Webpage that helps users find safe accommodations. My technical toolkit includes ReactJS, Firebase, NodeJS, SQL, and UX design, all of which I use to bring my ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            As I continue to grow in my career, I'm driven by the same curiosity and passion that first brought me into the world of technology. Whether it's developing new software or enhancing existing systems, I am eager to contribute to projects that make a meaningful difference. My journey from aspiring game developer to dedicated software engineer has been filled with learning and growth, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.
